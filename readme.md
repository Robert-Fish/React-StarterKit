# React-Webpack-StarterKit

A simple starter kit to get you started with ReactJS and Webpack combined with Babel. This will allow you to build anything, using the ReactJS library and Webpack 4.

## Getting Started

All you need to do is run <code>npm install</code> and it will do the rest of the work. I've included some scripts to easily run webpack. <code>npm start</code> will build and bundle your javascript and serve it to the browser with hot reloading. <code>npm build</code> will build and bundle all your JavaScript into the dist(this folder will be automatically created during the process) to allow you to easily use in production.

### Prerequisites

* Npm (atleast 5.6.0)
* Node (atleast 8.11.1)

## Built With

* [ReactJs](https://reactjs.org/) - The UI library used
* [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) - The resource bundler used
* [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) - An amazing compiler used to transpile our JavaScript
